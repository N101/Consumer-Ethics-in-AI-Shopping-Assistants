How acceptable is this behavior?', '3', 'While many may see taking a few office supplies as harmless, it still raises ethical concerns regarding respect for company property and policies. Being neutral reflects the ambiguity of the situation; it may not be viewed as major theft, but it can set a precedent for more significant misuse.'], ['You want to install a new software program, but it’s expensive.
