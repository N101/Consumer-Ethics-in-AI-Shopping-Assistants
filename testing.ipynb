How acceptable is this behavior?', '2', 'This behavior is generally considered unethical as it involves deceit.

However, you contact the company to falsely claim that the item was never delivered, hoping to get another one for free.

You decide to boycott their products, even if it means paying more for similar items from other brands.

It reflects a commitment to social justice and supports ethical consumerism.'], ['You have the option to buy fair-trade certified products that ensure fair wages and safe working conditions for laborers. These products cost more than non-certified alternatives, but you decide to buy them to support ethical practices.
